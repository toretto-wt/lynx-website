# Overview

This section aims to help readers understand how to optimize performance.
The first step in performance optimization is to accurately measure performance.
On the [Performance Metrics](/guide/performance/metrics/performance-api) page,
you can learn about the performance metrics provided by Lynx and which tools and
interfaces are available to obtain these metrics.

The [Lynx Trace](/guide/performance/analysis/record-trace) tool helps developers
perform performance analysis more efficiently and pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
On the Lynx Trace page, you can learn how to use Lynx Trace and conduct performance analysis.
