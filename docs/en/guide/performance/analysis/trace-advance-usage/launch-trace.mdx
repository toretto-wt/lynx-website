### FAQ

##### After clicking Load Trace shows: "Startup tracing is not enabled, cannot pull trace data"

- Make sure to set a valid trace duration (greater than 0) in Startup Trace Configuration, then restart the app and click "Load Trace" again.
- Ensure a Lynx page is opened during or after the app startup process before clicking "Load Trace".

##### Clicking Load Trace shows: "Startup tracing is in progress, please try again later"

- The app startup trace is still being recorded. Please wait for the process to finish and try clicking "Load Trace" again later.
