# MetricFcpEntry

FCP is a key performance metric that measures the time taken for the [first-screen rendering](guide/spec#first-screen-rendering-or-fsr) of lynx app to complete. It refers to the time taken for users to see any content (such as text or images) on a lynx app for the first time. `MetricFcpEntry` interface provides timing information about this metric, inheriting from [`PerformanceEntry`](../performance-entry).

The FCP event is triggered when Lynx completes the rendering of the first frame of the lynx app. For lynx apps that rely on network requests or asynchronous I/O to fetch data, the typical state monitored at FCP is the loading page or a placeholder, as shown in the diagram below:

Depending on different starting points, Lynx provides three metrics: `fcp`, `lynxFcp`, and `totalFcp`. Each metric's definition in the rendering process is illustrated in the diagram below:

## Example

This example demonstrates how to obtain a `MetricFcpEntry`.

Lynx calculates the FCP upon completion of the first frame rendering. If you have provided container-related timestamps using [LynxView.setExtraTiming](api/lynx-native-api/lynx-view/set-extra-timing), the `MetricFcpEntry` includes `fcp`, `lynxFcp`, and `totalFcp`. Otherwise, the `MetricFcpEntry` only contains `lynxFcp`. After supplementing the [container](guide/spec#container) timestamp, the remaining metrics will be recalculated. Once recalculation is complete, Lynx will send a new `MetricFcpEntry` containing all the metrics.

## Instance Properties

### [entryType](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#entryType)

```ts
entryType: string;
```

The type of performance event; the value for all instances of this class is fixed as `metric`.

### [name](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#name)

```ts
name: string;
```

The specific name of the performance event; the value for all instances of this class is fixed as `fcp`.

### fcp

```ts
fcp?: PerformanceMetric;
```

The time taken from preparing the [TemplateBundle](api/lynx-native-api/template-bundle) to the completion of the first rendering, with a data type of [`PerformanceMetric`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-metric).

Calculation formula: `fcp = LoadBundleEntry.paintEnd - InitContainerEntry.prepareTemplateStart`.

### lynxFcp

```ts
lynxFcp: PerformanceMetric;
```

The time taken from loading the [TemplateBundle](api/lynx-native-api/template-bundle) to the completion of the first rendering, with a data type of [`PerformanceMetric`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-metric).

Calculation formula: `lynxFcp = LoadBundleEntry.paintEnd - LoadBundleEntry.loadBundleStart`.

### totalFcp

```ts
totalFcp?: PerformanceMetric;
```

The time taken from the user opening the page to the completion of the first rendering, with a data type of [`PerformanceMetric`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-metric).

Calculation formula: `totalFcp = LoadBundleEntry.paintEnd - InitContainerEntry.openTime`.
