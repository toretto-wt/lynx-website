# Performance APIs

The Performance API is a set of tools for precisely measuring the performance of Lynx applications, helping developers pinpoint bottlenecks in critical phases such
as loading, rendering, and user interactions.

## Concepts and usage

The Performance API provides many built-in metrics to describe key moments at various stages of page rendering, helping developers improve page performance. It
assists developers in ensuring quick response during phases such as component rendering and user interaction. To use them, one needs to understand the following core concepts:

- Entry Object

  [`lynx.performance`](api/lynx-api/lynx/lynx-performance) serves as the entry point to the performance monitoring system.

- Performance Observer

  The [`PerformanceObserver`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-observer) interface is used to listen for various types of performance entries.

- Performance Events

  Performance events are represented by [`PerformanceEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry). `PerformanceEntry` includes basic information such as
  the event name `name` and event type `entryType`. All performance events (e.g., application initialization time, page load time) inherit from the `PerformanceEntry`
  interface and extend it with additional properties.

## Guides

The following guides help you to understand key concepts of the Performance API and provide an overview about its abilities:

- [Evaluating Performance](guide/performance/evaluating-performance): This is the core guide for evaluating page performance. The article highlights crucial
  performance metrics to focus on and demonstrates their application in typical scenarios.
- [Timing Flag](guide/performance/timing-flag): Timing Flags can help you track the performance of important data updates. This article explains how to use
  `__lynx_timing_flag` to monitor the [Lynx Pipeline](guide/spec#lynx-pipeline).
