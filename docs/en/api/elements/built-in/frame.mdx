# `<frame>`

A page element similar to HTML's `<iframe>`, which can embed a Lynx page into the current page.

:::tip
The `<frame>` element was introduced in Lynx version 3.4. To use this element, the Lynx dependency version must be upgraded to 3.4 or higher.
:::

## Attribute

:::caution
`<frame>` does not currently support automatic height adjustment. You need to manually set the width and height of the frame.
:::

### `src` <Required /> \{#required-src}

```ts
src: string;
```

Sets the loading path for the frame resource. The resource pointed to by the path will be fetched as a template via [TemplateResourceFetcher](../../lynx-native-api/lynx-template-resource-fetcher/fetch-template.mdx).

:::info

1. The page loaded by `<frame>` can be any Lynx page, but [Lazy Bundle](/guide/spec.html#lazy-bundle) is not currently supported.
2. If the loaded resource is a local offline resource, the frame page can be displayed on the screen in the same frame as the current Lynx page.

:::

### `data`

```ts
data?: object;
```

Passes data to the nested Lynx page within the frame.
