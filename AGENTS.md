# Repository Instructions

## Contribution Workflow

Follow the [commit](./CONTRIBUTING.md#commits) and
[pull request](./CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) conventions in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`. Automated reviewers must also follow the policy
embedded in [the pull request template](./.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Downstream Compatibility

This repository is consumed by the in-house Lynx documentation site through a
pinned git submodule and local `file:` dependency.

### Directly Consumed Paths

The downstream prepare flow consumes these OSS paths:

- Copied or merged content: `docs/`, `i18n.json`, and `sharedDocs/`
- Symlinked runtime: `src/` and `theme/`
- Imported configuration: `tailwind.config.js`
- Package contract: `package.json`
- Generated-data inputs: `packages/lynx-living-spec/`,
  `packages/lynx-compat-data/`, `packages/lynx-example-packages/`,
  `packages/lynx-ui-example-packages/`, and
  `packages/lynxtron-example-packages/`

The downstream repository replaces `docs/public/lynx-examples` and applies
internal content overlays after copying OSS content.

### Downstream Tool Contract

The downstream prepare flow directly executes:

- `scripts/luna-demo.js`
- `scripts/lynx-example.js`

The downstream directly executes `scripts/lynx-living-spec.js` from its
installed `lynx-doc` dependency through its own Living Spec orchestration layer.
It prepares downstream source overlays first and runs the generator with the
downstream repository root as the working directory.

Keep these script paths, caller-working-directory behavior, environment
variables, and generated output layouts compatible with downstream callers.

## Portable Build and Generation Tooling

Prepare and build tooling runs across local development, GitHub Actions,
Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and downstream consumers. Node-based generators must
not invoke undeclared host commands. In particular, do not depend on `rsync`;
it is not available in every Cloudflare Pages build image supported by this
site.

Prefer `node:*` APIs or declared package dependencies. If an operating-system
tool is unavoidable, explicitly provision it in every caller and supported
build image, document the prerequisite, and add CI coverage for its absence or
availability. A command being installed on a developer machine or GitHub-hosted
runner does not make it part of the build contract.

### `api-stats.json` doc links

`packages/lynx-compat-data`'s `gen-stats` emits a `doc_url` per API. **When the
caller supplies a docs root** — via `--docs-root <dir>` (resolved against the
working directory) or `LYNX_COMPAT_DOCS_ROOT` — it emits only the URLs that
resolve to a route in that tree; without one it emits every URL unchecked. The
OSS site supplies its own root through the `gen:compat-stats` script, which is
therefore the script to use when regenerating these stats by hand. The root is
never inferred from the package's location, so an install layout cannot decide
which routes the data is checked against.

A consumer that generates these stats itself should pass its own docs root, and
gets a `doc_url` set matching the pages it publishes. Omitting the option skips
verification and emits every URL unchecked; naming a root that does not exist
is an error rather than a silent skip, so a run either verifies against the
tree it was told to use or does not verify at all.

## Mirrored Integration Contracts

The downstream repository maintains local versions of
`shared-route-config.ts`, `shared-og-config.ts`, `rspress.config.ts`, and
`tsconfig.json`. These files are not copied from OSS, but their runtime
contracts must remain compatible.

Keep OSS runtime imports compatible with the downstream resolver aliases.
Coordinate changes to shared configuration exports or resolver aliases with
the downstream repository.

The in-house scheduled sync runs daily at 09:30 UTC+8. For coordinated changes,
especially those that must land internally first, plan the landing order around
this window so an OSS change is not synced before its downstream counterpart is
ready.

## Host-Root Imports

`@site` resolves to the consuming site's repository root. Existing `@site/*`
imports are part of the current OSS/downstream compatibility surface.

Do not add a new `@site/*` import merely to avoid a relative path or to reach
consumer-specific configuration. For new code:

- Use a relative import when the target remains inside the owning OSS module.
- Use an OSS-owned package export for reusable shared code.
- Use a documented exact-match resolver alias when a downstream site must
  intentionally inject configuration. For example, `@og-config` is configured
  as the exact-match `@og-config$` alias in Rspress.

Any new `@site/*` dependency requires a matching module and compatibility
contract in every supported consumer.

## Change Rules

- Do not rename or remove a consumed path without a compatibility plan and a
  coordinated downstream update.
- Treat package names, script environment variables, output directories, and
  exported configuration fields as interfaces.
- Keep internal-only content and behavior in the in-house repository.
- Request downstream validation for changes affecting this contract.
- Changes to CI, build or generation workflows, release behavior, or downstream
  interfaces require human review and must be merged manually. Review agents
  may approve these changes but must not auto-merge them.

## Verification

When a change affects any downstream compatibility contract above, verify this
repository with:

```sh
pnpm run prepare
pnpm run build
```

Then request validation against the updated OSS pin in the in-house repository,
following that repository's own setup and build instructions.
